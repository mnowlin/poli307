## Environmental Policy 

::: {.incremental}
* **Environmental Policy**: government action related to the natural environment [@rinfretUSEnvironmentalPolicy2019,2]

* **Environmental Policymaking**: a complex process that involves multiple actors across multiple decision-making venues 
:::

# Why are environmental policy issues controversial? Why don't we agree? 

## Environmental Issues 

::: {.incremental}
* The difficulty of collective action 

* Distributional conflicts over _costs_ and _benefits_ 

* The structure of the political and policymaking system 

* Science 
  * Politicization of science 
  * _Scientific uncertainty_

:::

* Pertain to desirable end states or behaviors

* Transcend specific situations

* Guide selection or evaluation of behavior and events

* Ordered by relative importance
:::

## Core Values: Political Ideology

::: {.incremental}
* **The environment as a political issue has become increasing polarized across ideological beliefs** 

* **Solution aversion**
  * If government regulation is the _solution_ then there isn't a _problem_

* **Elite driven**
  * Elected officials 
  * Energy and industry groups 
:::

## Environmental Values 

::: {.incremental}
* **Early environmental values: _Preservation_ and _Conservation_**
  * **Preservationist**: Preserve and protect nature for its own sake
  * **Conservation**: Prudent use of natural resources

* **Contemporary conservation**: contains strands of traditional preservationist and conservation ideas

* **Deep Ecology**: humans are merely a part of the larger ecosystem, which should be protected without the consideration of harm to humans
:::


## Environmental Values: Environmentalists vs Development

### New Ecological Paradigm scale

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
* The balance of nature is very delicate and easily upset
* Humans live on a planet with very limited room and resources
* Humans are seriously abusing the environment
:::
::: {.column}
* _Humans will eventually learn enough about how nature works to be able to control it_ 
* _The so-called ‘ecological crisis’ facing humankind has been greatly exaggerated_ 
* _The Earth has plenty of natural resources if we just learn how to develop them_
:::
::::::::::::::


## Environmental Values: Environmentalists vs Development

### Cornucopians

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
* Emphasis on economic growth and markets 
* Environmental restrictions limit economic well-being
* High confidence in technological solutions
* Individual liberty: 
  * Environmentalists are "watermelons"

  * Cultural bias: _Shared values and beliefs_
  * Social relations: _Patterns of interpersonal relations_  
  * Ways of life: _Viable combinations of social relations and cultural bias_

:::

## Cultural Theory 

::: {.incremental}
* **Ways of life (or cultural types or cultural worldviews) are captured by two cross cutting dimensions; grid and group** 
  * **Grid**: _Degree that an individual's life is limited by externally imposed prescriptions; social regulation_
  * **Group**: _Degree that an individual is incorporated into bounded units_     
  
* **Combining the grid and group dimensions produce four viable ways of life, or cultural types**
:::

## Cultural Theory 

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
![](img/figure4.3.jpg)
:::
::: {.column}
**Hierarchical**: Tight groups with clearly defined roles 

**Egalitarian**: Group commitments and no social stratification

## Cultural Cognition 

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
* **Values and beliefs guide how people _think_ about policy issues** 

* Environmental policy debates are not about science as much as they are _about opposing cultural values and worldviews through which that science is seen_ 
:::
::: {.column}

::::::::::::::

# Does increased knowledge reduce the polarization of views about climate change?

# What? Why? How? 

## Mechanisms of Cultural Cognition

::: {.incremental}
* **Cultural identity-protective cognition** 
  * Policy attitudes do not threaten an individual's _identity_ 
  * Values are connected to identity 

* **Culturally biased assimilation of information** 
  * Information is processed in a way that confirms values and prior beliefs 
  * _The "smarter" you are the better you are at aligning information with your values_ 
:::


## Mechanisms of Cultural Cognition

::: {.incremental}
* **Cultural availability** 
  * Events or information that matches beliefs more readily come to mind 

* **Cultural credibility**
  * Sources that match beliefs are more credible 

* **Cultural-identity affirmation**
