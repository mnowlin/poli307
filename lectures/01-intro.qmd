## Collective-Action Problems 

::: {.incremental}
* **Situations that arise when the goals of the individual conflict with those of the group**

* **How do we address collective-action problems**?
  * Institutions   
:::

## Institutions

::: {.incremental}
* **Institutions are the humanly devised constraints that structure political, economic, and social interaction**

* **Institutions consist of both informal constraints (sanctions, taboos, customs, traditions, and codes of conduct), and formal rules (constitutions, laws, property rights)** 

* **Institutions can address some collective action problems, but can cause or exacerbate others**  
:::

## Institutions

::: {.incremental}
* **Markets**
  * Decentralized collection of buyers and sellers 
  * Can arise from _informal constraints_ 

* **Governments** 
  * Produce and enforce _formal rules_ 
  * Make _public policy_ 
:::

## Environmental Policy 

::: {.incremental}
* **Environmental Policy**: government action related to the natural environment

* **Environmental Policymaking**: a complex process that involves multiple actors across multiple decision-making venues 

* **Environmental policy is about making tough choices** 
  * Often these choices involve governments assigning (sometimes unintentionally) _costs_ and _benefits_ to individuals, groups, firms, and communities 

* **Environmental Politics** 
  * Politics is about who gets what, where, and when
  * Distributive conflicts arise around the distribution of the costs and benefits of environmental policy 
  * _Environmental justice_ 
:::

## Environmental Dilemmas 

::: {.incremental}
* Clean or dirty air? 
  * Air pollution has decreased since the 1970s, but what about climate change? 

* Is the water really drinkable? 
  * Nonpoint source water pollution 

* Plants and animals 
  * Trade-offs associated with habitat and species protection 

* Waste
  * Who wants a landfill next door?
