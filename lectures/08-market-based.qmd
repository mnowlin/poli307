# Markets and Market Failures

## Markets 

::: {.incremental}
* **A decentralized collection of buyers and sellers whose interactions determine the allocation of a good or a set of goods through exchange**

* Market rules
  * Medium of exchange 
  * Way to communicate price 
  * _Property rights_ 

* Exchange provides gains from trade

* **When assumptions are met, markets provide the most _efficient_ allocation of resources**

## Markets 

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
**Assumptions**

* Perfect competition 
* Perfect information 
* Perfectly complete

## Market Failures 

::: {.incremental}
* ~~Perfect competition~~ 
  * **Insufficient competition**: Monopolies

* ~~Perfect information~~ 
  * **Asymmetric information**: Used car

* ~~Perfectly complete~~
  * **Externalities**: Pollution 

* **Common-pool goods** 
  * Open pasture

* **Public goods** 
  * Clean air
:::

## Market Failures 

::: {.incremental}
* A market-failure means that markets are _not_ providing the most efficient allocation of resources 

* **Market-based policies are intended to address efficiency concerns**
:::

## Market-Based Environmental Policy 

::: {.incremental}
* **Incorporate market principles into government policies** 

* **Polluters have an incentive to reduce their emissions** 

* **Decentralized _as compared to command-and-control regulation_** 

* **Two types**
  * **Using markets** 
  * **Creating markets**

# Coase Theorem 


## Coase Theorem

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
_Private bargaining will result in the efficient resolution of negative externalities, without the need for government intervention, as long as property rights are fully allocated_
:::

## Coase Theorem 

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
**Works when _transaction costs_ are low** 

* **Transaction costs**: The costs associated with a transaction 
  * Monitoring and enforcement

## Coase Theorem 

**Property rights**: Rights of individuals to own or control property including the right to use, transfer, or _exclude_ 

:::::::::::::: {.columns}

**Non-excludable**

## Coase Theorem 

### What can we take from Coase?

::: {.incremental}
* Importance of _property rights_ and _transaction costs_ 

* Self-organization among users can address common-pool resource problems (see _Elinor Ostrom's work_)

* Markets don't _fail_, rather markets are _missing_
  * Government policy should address property rights and lessen transaction costs

# Market-Based Environmental Policy 


## Market-Based Environmental Policy

**Using markets**: Getting the prices right

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
**Externality** 

Social cost $>$ Private cost

Socially efficient outcome = Private cost + **Tax** 

**Internalize the externality**
:::
::: {.column}
![](img/external.jpg)

::::::::::::::



## Market-Based Environmental Policy 

**Creating Markets**: Creating property rights

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
**Common-pool good = no property rights**

* Distribute allowances 
  * _Fishing quota_
  * _Cap-and-trade systems for pollution_

**Allowances create de-facto property rights**

## Market-Based Environmental Policy 

**Using and Creating markets**: Filling in the missing demand curve

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
**Marginal benefit of abatement = Demand curve** 

* Public good = no demand 
:::
::: {.column}
![](img/ta.png)
:::
::::::::::::::

::: {.notes}
the central problem, of course, is that such a demand curve never arises, because pollution control is a classic case of a public good. every individual, comparing the cost of paying for pollution control (borne entirely by herself ) with the benefit (shared by others), finds that it is in her self-interest not to contribute. But when everyone free rides, the market demand for pollution control effectively falls to zero.11 note that the “supply curve” for abatement already exists; it simply corresponds to the marginal cost of controlling pollution.the hitch is that no firm will supply a good whose price is zero.

## Market-Based Environmental Policy 

**Using and Creating markets**: Filling in the missing demand curve

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column}
**Policy sets the demand curve** 

* Fixed quantity (X*)
  * Cap-and-trade 

* Fixed price (T*)
  * Tax 

**$/Ton is the same**
