## Collective Action Problems 

### Situations that arise when the goals of the individual conflict with those of the group

* **Examples** 
  * _Externalities_ 
  * _Common-pool goods_ 
  * _Dirty dishes_ 
  * _Slackers with group work_ 

# How are collective-action problems addressed? 

## Institutions 

::: {.incremental}
* Institutions are the humanly devised constraints that structure political, economic, and social interaction

* Institutions consist of both informal constraints (sanctions, taboos, customs, traditions, and codes of conduct), and formal rules (constitutions, laws, property rights)

* _Markets_ and _Governments_ 
:::

## Markets 

::: {.incremental}
* Markets are decentralized institutions that promote voluntary exchange between buyers and sellers

* Market rules
  * Medium of exchange 
  * Way to communicate price 
  * _Property rights_ 

* Exchange provides gains from trade

* Markets provide the most _efficient_ allocation of resources

# Market Failures

## Examples of Market Failures 

::: {.incremental}
* **Externalities** 
  * Pollution 

* **Common-pool goods** 
  * Open pasture

* **Public goods** 
  * Clean air

## Governments

::: {.incremental}
* **Public Policy**: 
  * The outcomes of government processes that are aimed at alleviating a societal _problem_  

* **What is the _cause_ of the "problem"?** 
:::

## Governments 

::: {.incremental}
* **Environmental Policy**: Government action (policy) related to the natural environment
  * **Includes (among other things)**: Public lands and waters; wilderness; wildlife; pollution; ecosystem services; human health and safety; energy use; transportation; urban design and building standards; agriculture and food production; and human population growth

* **Environmental policies take multiple _forms_**: Legislation, executive orders, agency rules and regulations, and court decisions

# The Environmental Policymaking Process

## The Environmental Policymaking Process

### Context 

### Stages 

### Structural Factors 

## Context of Policymaking 

::: {.incremental}
* **Current Circumstances**
  * _Focusing events_: Major events that galvanize attention on a particular issue such as a crisis or a disaster
  * Public opinion 
  * Other priorities  

* **Economic Conditions** 
  * Bad economy, less interest in other things 
:::

## Context of Policymaking 

::: {.incremental}
* **Politics** 
  * Elections 
  * Constituent/interest group support

## The Stages Model 

### 1. Problem identification and definition

::: {.incremental}
* Is something a _problem_ 

* How is the problem _understood_ 

* These are debated 

* **Framing** 
  * Give meaning and context to information
:::


## The Stages Model 

### 2. Agenda Setting

::: {.incremental}
* _Policy agenda_: The issues currently being addressed by the policymaking system 
* _Agenda-setting_: The process through which policy issues reach the agenda
* **Space on the agenda is finite and competitive** 
:::

## The Stages Model 

### 2. Agenda Setting

**Getting on the agenda = Gaining attention** 

::: {.incremental}
* _Mobilization_: individuals and organized groups bring attention to a problem   

* _Focusing events_ 

* _Policy entrepreneurs_: individuals willing to invest resources into achieving a policy goal 

* _Public "mood"_: how concerned is the public about the problem? 
:::

## The Stages Model 

### 3. Policy Formulation

::: {.incremental}
* What should be done about a problem? 
* Involves technical analysis and politics 

* **Policy design**: The content of the policy
  * Policy goals 
  * Policy instruments
  * Implementation structure  
:::

<!-- 
# Environmental Policy Goals 

--

**The outcomes that policymakers want the policy to achieve** 

--

* For environmental policy, policy goals are typically broadly defined as some level of environmental protection, harm reduction, or improved management of a natural resource 

* _A reduction in the amount of greenhouse gases being emitted into the atmosphere_  

---

class: title title-2

# Causal Framework 

**The theory that connects the policy (_p_) to the desired outcome (_Y_)** 

--

* $\text{Y} = \text{p} + \omega$ 

* _How would a carbon tax reduce emissions_? 

--

* _Uncertainty_: can be reduced with more data

--

* _Ambiguity_: can not necessarily be reduced with more data  

---

class: title title-2

# Policy Instruments 

**The means of achieving policy goals** 

* Policy instrument $\rightarrow$ Policy goal

--

**Four categories** 
* Using markets: _carbon tax_  
* Creating markets: _cap-and-trade_ 
* Using environmental regulations: _command-and-control_  
* Engaging the public: _provide information_ 

---

class: title title-2

# Implementation Structure 

**Implementation structures include the agencies; state and local governments; and other actors that are involved in implementing a policy**

--

* Who is going to carry out the policy and how are they going to do it?

## The Stages Model 

### 5. Policy Implementation

**Process by which policies enacted by government are put into effect by the relevant agencies** 

::: {.incremental}
* Implementation often involves **delegation** 
  * Agencies must define "_swimmable_" waters

* Implementation often involves **policy creation**
  * EPA makes a regulation under the authority of the Clean Air Act 
:::

## The Stages Model 

### 6. Policy Evaluation

**Measurement and assessment of policy and program effects, including successes and failures** 

::: {.incremental}
* Is a policy working? 
* Causality
* How to measure
* Where to get data?
:::

::: {.notes}
_Was the Kyoto Protocol successful_?
:::

# Structural Factors 

## Checks and Balances

| Congress | President | Courts 
--- | --- | --- | --- 
**Legislative** | **make laws** | recommend laws, veto, regulations | review laws  
**Executive** | override vetos, oversight | **enforce and implement laws** | review executive acts 
**Judicial** | advise and consent | pardon, nominate judges | **interpret laws** 

## Structural Factors 

::: {.incremental}
* **Federalism** 
  * A system of government in which there is a national level of government with various sub- national governmental units

* **Fragmentation** 
  * Policymaking authority is diffused across the branches of government, the states, and civil society 
:::


## Other Factors 

### Governmental tendencies that result from the context, process, and structural factors of policymaking

::: {.incremental}
* **Incrementalism**: small changes made over time 

* **Reactionary**: governments respond to problems rather than be proactive to prevent a problem 

* **Pluralism**: competition among different groups ensures that no single group will dominate government
