# Environmental Regulations

## Environmental Regulations 

### The Stages Model

## Environmental Regulations 

**5. Policy Implementation: Process by which policies enacted by government are put into effect by the relevant agencies** 

* Implementation often involves **delegation** 
 * Agencies must define "_swimmable_" waters 

* Implementation often involves **policy creation**
  * EPA makes a regulation under the authority of the Clean Air Act 


## Environmental Regulations

## Environmental Regulations 

::: {.incremental}
**Goal Setting** 

* Congress often sets broad goals that a law is designed to achieve
  * CWA: "swimmable" and "fishable" waters

* Weighed against other social and economic considerations 
:::


## Environmental Regulations 

::: {.incremental}
**Criteria determination** 

* What is "clear air?" What is "clean water?" 

* Requires extensive data collection and analysis

* **In the CAA and CWA public health was the only consideration** 
:::


## Environmental Regulations 

::: {.incremental}
**Standard setting** 

* Reflects the standards that are needed for "clean air" and/or "clean water" 

* Determinations about the level of pollution that is acceptable for public and environmental health

* Performance or technology 
:::

## Environmental Regulations 

::: {.incremental}
**Enforcement of standards** 

* Facilities are monitored and inspected 

* Reporting requirements 
:::



## Environmental Regulations 

### Assumptions of command-and-control regulations

::: {.incremental}
* **Top-down**: Other stakeholders involved, but regulations come from government agencies 

* **Government knows best**: Has the information and expertise to make regulations 

* **One-size-fits-all**: Regulations are applied uniformly 

* **Deterrence strategy**: Facilities must comply or face consequences and absent regulation, facilities would pollute 

* **Little incentive to improve**: Facilities will meet the requirement, but not do any more to reduce pollution 

:::


## Environmental Regulations 

### Command-and-control (federalism) in action

::: {.incremental}
* **Regulatory structure**: Rulemaking process occurs at the federal level, with implementation and enforcement delegated to the states 

* _States collectively issue more than 90 percent of all environmental permits, complete more than 75 percent of all environmental enforcement actions, and rely on the federal government for less than 25 percent of their total funding on environmental and natural resource concerns_ 

:::


## Environmental Regulations 

### Challenges of implementing command-and-control regulations

::: {.incremental}
* **Politics and competing priorities**  
  * Environmental policy is both highly technical and highly political
  * Agencies are responsive to political control 

* **Federalism** 
  * Adds complexity and coordination problems

## Environmental Regulations 

### Challenges of implementing command-and-control regulations

  * Knowledge 

* **Administrative structures and discretion**
