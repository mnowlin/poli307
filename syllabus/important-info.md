# Important Information 

## Academic Integrity Statement 

As members of the College of Charleston community, we affirm, embrace and hold ourselves accountable to the core values of integrity, academic excellence, liberal arts education, respect for the individual student, diversity, equity and inclusion, student centeredness, innovation and public mission.  Congruent with these core values, the College of Charleston expects that every student and community member has a responsibility to uphold the standards of the honor code, as outlined in the [Student Handbook](https://deanofstudents.cofc.edu/honor-system/studenthandbook/index.php), In pursuit of academic learning, you are expected to reference the work of other scholars, and complete your own academic work, while utilizing appropriate resources for assistance.  Any acts of suspected academic dishonesty will be reported to the Office of the Dean of Students and addressed through the conduct process.  Your adherence to these practices and expectations plays a vital role in fostering a campus culture that balances trust and the pursuit of knowledge while producing a strong foundation of academic excellence at the College of Charleston.  Any questions regarding these expectations can be clarified by your instructor.

## Inclement Weather, Pandemic or Substantial Interruption of Instruction 

If in-person classes are suspended, faculty will announce to their students a detailed plan for a change in modality to ensure the continuity of learning. All students must have access to a computer equipped with a web camera, microphone, and Internet access. Resources are available to provide students with these essential tools.

## Diversity and Inclusion in the classroom 

I am committed to creating an inclusive and accessible classroom environment for all students. I view the diversity that students bring to this class as a resource, strength, and benefit. It is my intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender, sexuality, disability, generational status, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, religious background, and immigration status. Any suggestions for promoting a positive and open environment will be appreciated and given serious consideration.

In addition, there are several resources on and off campus to help. You can visit the Cougar Pantry in the Stern Center (2nd floor), a student-run food pantry that provides dry-goods and hygiene products at no charge to any student in need. 

## Religious Accommodation for Students 

The College of Charleston community is enriched by students of many faiths that have various religious observances, practices, and beliefs.  We value student rights and freedoms, including the right of each student to adhere to individual systems of religion.  The College prohibits discrimination against any student because of such student’s religious belief or any absence thereof. 

\vspace{0.10in}
\noindent The College acknowledges that religious practices differ from tradition to tradition and that the demands of religious observances in some traditions may cause conflicts with student schedules.  In affirming this diversity, like many other colleges and universities, the College supports the concept of “reasonable accommodation for religious observance” in regard to class attendance, and the scheduling of examinations and other academic work requirements, unless the accommodation would create an undue hardship on the College.  Faculty are required, as part of their responsibility to students and the College, to ascribe to this policy and to ensure its fair and full implementation. 

\vspace{0.10in}
\noindent The accommodation request imposes responsibilities and obligations on both the individual requesting the accommodation and the College.  Faculty members are expected to reasonably accommodate individual religious practices.  Examples of reasonable accommodations for student absences might include:  rescheduling of an exam or giving a make-up exam for the student in question; altering the time of a student’s presentation; allowing extra-credit assignments to substitute for missed class work or arranging for an increased flexibility in assignment dates.  Regardless of any accommodation that may be granted, students are responsible for satisfying all academic objectives, requirements and prerequisites as defined by the instructor and by the College.
